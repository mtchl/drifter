Little Rose displays great interest in the story. Lindsay tells of how after a big flood on the Murrumbidgee, Darkie found a child two years old on the river and she had been adopted by Miss Lindsay, his sister, who is away on a shoppingexpedition. They had been been unable to establish her identity, but had called her Rose Murray. In order to learn more of Jeffrey's wonderful plans for the river, she asks Jeffrey to accompany her to the river bank, to see some of its pretty spots and where he regales her with stories.
